But the biggest problem was that ChatGPT didn’t follow the single clearest element of my request: tell me what happened in the last five years. ChatGPT’s report title declares that it covers 2019 to 2024. Yet the latest case it mentions was decided in 2023, after which it soberly concludes that the law remains “a robust shield” whose boundaries are being “refine[d].” A layperson could easily think that means nothing happened last year. An informed reader would realize something was very wrong.
